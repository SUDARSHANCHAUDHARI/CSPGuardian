## Overview

CSP Guardian is a defensive analysis tool that fetches a URL's response headers, parses Content-Security-Policy directives, evaluates iframe and framing posture, and produces a risk-scored report with remediation hints. Useful for auditing security headers on production sites, kiosks, signage, and embedded webviews.

The current MVP is a Python CLI. A FastAPI + React web dashboard is scaffolded under `apps/` for future development.

## Features

- Fetches and parses response security headers
- Analyzes Content-Security-Policy directives
- Detects iframe / framing policy gaps (clickjacking risk)
- Checks cookie security flags (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`)
- Scores CORS and HSTS posture
- Outputs JSON findings, risk summary, Markdown report, and triage handoff

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- No third-party Python packages (standard library only)
- Optional: Docker for the demo container
- Network access for live URL scanning (sample mode works offline)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUDARSHANCHAUDHARI/CSPGuardian.git
cd CSPGuardian
pip install .
```

This registers the `csp-guardian` CLI command.

To run without installing:

```bash
python3 main.py --help
```

## Usage

Scan a target URL:

```bash
python3 main.py --url https://example.com --out-dir reports
```

Generated outputs in `reports/`:

- `headers.json` — captured response headers
- `findings.json` — flagged policy gaps
- `summary.json` — risk score and severity counts
- `report.md` — Markdown header / CSP report
- `triage.md` — analyst triage checklist

```

## Docker Demo

```bash
docker compose run --rm api
```

## Safe Use

This project is defensive and analysis-focused. Use only on websites, kiosks, and lab environments you own or have explicit written permission to assess.

## Status

Working Python CLI MVP. Web dashboard scaffold present but not yet implemented.

## Roadmap

- Live HTTPS certificate inspection
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks
- Bulk URL scanning with concurrency
- GitHub Actions integration for policy regression checks
- Web dashboard for findings and remediation suggestions

## About

I'm Sudarshan Chaudhari, a Senior Quality Engineer, Test Automation specialist, and AI systems builder based in Bangkok, Thailand.

I have 13+ years of experience in software quality engineering, working across SaaS, fintech, gaming, web, mobile, cloud, and digital signage platforms. My background combines hands-on test automation with QA leadership, test strategy, CI/CD, release quality, production investigation, and cross-platform validation.

Alongside my professional QA career, I run [SudarshanTechLabs](https://sudarshantechlabs.com/), my independent engineering and product lab where I design, build, test, and ship software across Android, web, AI, cybersecurity, developer tooling, and cross-platform applications.

### What I work on

- ⚙️ **Quality Engineering & Test Automation** — Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, Appium, API testing, automation frameworks, end-to-end testing, CI/CD, release gates, GitHub Actions, risk-based testing, and production validation
- 🤖 **AI Systems & Automation** — AI agents, multi-agent orchestration, MCP servers, AI-assisted QA, prompt tooling, developer workflows, automation systems, and Claude Code plugins
- 📱 **Mobile & Cross-Platform Applications** — Android applications built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Google Play releases, automated build and publishing pipelines, and cross-platform development spanning iOS, web, Windows, and macOS
- 🌐 **Web Applications & Platforms** — Full-stack applications using Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, Cloudflare, REST APIs, and modern web infrastructure
- 🛠️ **Developer Tooling & CLI Engineering** — Rust, Python, TypeScript, CLI utilities, multi-repository tooling, build automation, release tooling, and engineering productivity systems
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & Observability** — Threat detection, log analysis, security auditing, vulnerability assessment, monitoring, and security-focused developer tools
- 📺 **Digital Signage & Device Platforms** — Content validation, playback testing, device compatibility, production investigation, monitoring, and QA across diverse hardware and operating-system environments

My work sits at the intersection of quality engineering, automation, AI, and software development. I approach products with a QA mindset from the beginning: understanding failure modes, designing for testability, automating repetitive work, and building release confidence into the engineering process.

Through SudarshanTechLabs, I also build products and tools from idea to production, covering architecture, development, testing, CI/CD, release automation, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance.
